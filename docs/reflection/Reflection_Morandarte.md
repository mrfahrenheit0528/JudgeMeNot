## **REFLECTION: MORANDARTE**

Our group collectively tackled the JudgeMeNot system for the AppDev and IAS requirements, and we delivered a modular, full-stack solution in Python and Flet. Our architecture is such that models/ (database schema), services/ (business logic), and views/ (UI) are separated and responsibilities are distributed clearly, which is essential for concurrent development. The main IAS security features that we focused on were strong password hashing for users and full audit logging of sensitive actions like login and score submission.

My direct involvement with the UI part of the JudgeMeNot system was a combination of great annoyance, mainly because of the unstable behavior of the Flet framework when dealing with complex state changes and asynchronous updates, which wasn't predictable at all. My main task was to design the various user interfaces for different user roles, but I went through a lot of trouble due to an issue in which even the slightest alterations made to one screen would lead to the crashing or incorrect display of other, supposedly unconnected, parts of the application. This recurring instability demanded an extremely cautious and slow debugging process, proving that the real-world challenge of building a reliable, stateful application far outweighs theoretical coding.
