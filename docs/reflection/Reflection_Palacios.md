# Reflection JudgeMeNot Project

**"Will we finish this project before it finishes us?"**  
That's what I kept thinking when a typhoon hit our area and messed up our plans. For almost a month, there was no electricity, and we couldn't really work on the system, welp, up until now. I felt anxious a lot of the time, wondering if we'd ever be able to get back on track and finish what we started. It was frustrating, but we just had to take it one step at a time.

Luckily, we were able to push through and actually finish **JudgeMeNot**. Big shoutout to our lead programmer, **Elmo**, who kept us organized and motivated the whole time. Finishing the project despite all those challenges felt really rewarding. This experience taught me a lot about **teamwork, patience, and not giving up**, even when things don't go as planned.
